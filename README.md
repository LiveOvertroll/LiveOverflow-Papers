LiveOverflow leaks (currently only IP)

For several weeks, I was searching the IP myself. I promised myself, that once I found it, I would make it public, so here you go:
65.109.68.176

Now, you won't be able to join through this IP because of bots. You will need to join through the following IPs (Philipp changes them quite often): [IP list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assigned_/8_IPv4_address_blocks#List_of_assigned_/8_blocks_to_the_United_States_Department_of_Defense)
Then, if I understood  it correctly, a bot will leave for you.

Share this around!
